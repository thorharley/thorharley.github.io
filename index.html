	<h1>Seattle Crime Shifts Between Districts by Hour of Day</h1>
	<p>
	This short study examines crime rates in Seattle over the period June to August, 2014, with a view to assessing how offence rates may vary 
	both by time of day and by district. Data subsetting and initial exploration were performed with R, and the subsequent visualisations were created with D3.

	The first graph below shows the total number of offences (across all districts) committed by estimated hour of day. It is clear from this that crime 
	increases steadily through the day, peaking in the late	evening, and then diminishes rapidly after midnight.

	In the second graph below, we look at crime rates by district, and group them further by month to assess whether there are any intra-district
	trends evident as the summer progresses. Small temporal variations are apparent across the three months, but nothing to suggest any strong trends, which is not
	unexpected as there is no a priori reason to think that crime should vary over this time. It is, however, clear that certain districts have consistently -- and significantly -- higher offence rates then others, though without additional data
	on relative district area or population, relative per capita rates or other inferences can't be drawn.

	Lastly, the stacked bar graph below normalises and stacks relative rates for each district by hour of day, so as to be able to detect shifts in crime rates between districts with time. It is evident here that there is a relative shift of crime to certain areas late at night. For example, District 'E' more than doubles its proportion of offences between 11pm and 2am, which could imply that it is a nightlife area (rather than a suburban or business area, say), with a corresponding uptick of alcohol or drug-related crime at night. Further data mapping offence codes to labels could corroborate this.
